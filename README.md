# IBEX_35_WEB_SCRAPING
EXTRACT HISTORICAL DATA FROM IBEX 35
WE USED THE FOLLOWING URL TO START SCRAPING: https://es.investing.com/indices/spain-35-components. FROM THIS URL WE OBTAINED THE URLS OF EACH COMPONENT, WHERE HISTORICAL DATA IS STORED.
WE DID IT BY USING SELENIUM. ONCE THE URLÂ´S WERE STORED IN A LIST, WE PROCEED EXTRACTING THE DATA FROM THE 35 COMPONENTS INTO A CSV FILE. 
THE CHROME DRIVER VERSION USED FOR THIS PROYECT IS 119.0.6045.105	

THIS RESPOSITORY CONTAINS 2 CSV FILES, ONE OF THEM CONTAINING THE NUMERICAL DATA AND THE OTHER THE CATEGORICAL DATA.
THEN WE HAVE THE CODE IN THE XXX FILE.
FINALLY, WE,VE GOT ANOTHER .PY FILE CALLED INTENTO FECHA, WERE WE TRIED TO INTERACTE WITH THE WEBSITE TO GET DATA FROM ANOTHER INITIAL DATE BUT WE DIDNT SUCCEED.
